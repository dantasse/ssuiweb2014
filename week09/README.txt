Basics:
week09.pptx: class notes.
hello_world_server.js: a server that just responds hello. Doesn't use socket.io or anything.

More complicated, using socket.io:
barebones_chat.html: a basic chat service. Use socket.io to write the server.
barebones_solution: well, a solution to barebones_chat.
soney_chat: a prettier version of barebones_chat.
