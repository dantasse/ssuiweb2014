## Due: Thursday, September 11, 2014 by 10:30 am

### Goal
The goal of this project is to give you practice with JavaScript by completing a few small exercises.

Files Provided
The following files are in the same .zip folder as this project description was in:
p0.js			javascript file that you will need to edit
p0.html		html file that loads the p0 javascript file for testing 

Project Overview
For this project, modify p0.js by adding the functions below. Each function should behave as specified. You should also add a test function called runTests() which tests the functions that you wrote. The functions you need to define are below. You can ‘run’ your javascript file using p0.html. See the very last few lines of p0.js to see how you can easily call runTests once the p0.html page has loaded. IMPORTANT: Make sure your function names are correct!
